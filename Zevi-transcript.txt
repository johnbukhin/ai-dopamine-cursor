You were a product manager shipping 
 product without knowing how to write 
 code, barely knowing how to review code. 
 >> I have zero technical background. Did 
 music in high school when Sonnet 3.5 
 came out. I remember watching a YouTube 
 video building apps using Bolt or 
 Lovable. It basically felt like someone 
 came up to me and said, "You have 
 superpowers now." 
 >> These days, you're using cursor with 
 claw code. 
 >> If you're nontechnical like me, code is 
 terrifying, but AI just makes so much 
 possible in the next coming years. I 
 think everyone's going to become a 
 builder. Titles are going to collapse 
 and responsibilities are going to 
 collapse. 
 >> The main challenge people have is 
 reviewing the code that AI has written. 
 >> It's very difficult for me to catch 
 mistakes. What I'll do is basically / 
 review. This tells Claude to start 
 reviewing its own code. But what's even 
 cooler is I have codecs as well as 
 cursor open. I will have each of them 
 review the code. 
 >> This comes back to this quote which I 
 think everyone's always hearing. It's 
 not that you will be replaced by AI. 
 you'll be replaced by someone who's 
 better at using AI than you. 
 >> It's the best time to be a junior. 
 Contrary to what a lot of people are 
 saying, how there's no more junior roles 
 out there. Yeah, that's true. But also, 
 when else in history could you get out 
 of school and just build a startup on 
 your own? 
 Today, my guest is Zevy Arnowitz. Zev's 
 a PM at Meta. Prior to that, he was a PM 
 at Wix. And this is a truly remarkable 
 conversation that every non-technical 
 product person needs to hear. Zevy is 
 super young and has no technical 
 background, but as a smart, young, 
 ambitious person, has learned how to use 
 cursor and claude code to build 
 significant and real products completely 
 on his own. And he's created his own 
 very clever and effective workflow that 
 everyone listening can copy. To make 
 that copying even easier, at the top of 
 the show notes of this episode, you can 
 download all the prompts and slash 
 commands and start doing all of this 
 yourself. Zebie shows you how to work 
 with cursor to quickly add your ideas to 
 linear to explore your idea with AI, how 
 to develop your plan, how to then build 
 a thing, and then have different LLMs 
 review your code and update your 
 documentation and then use all of this 
 as a learning opportunity to develop 
 your own sense of how things work. I 
 haven't stopped thinking about this 
 conversation since we had it, and 
 everyone needs to pay attention to what 
 AI is unlocking for non-technical 
 people. A huge thank you to Tall Rav for 
 encouraging me to meet Zevy. If you

 >> Zevy, thank you so much for being here 
 and welcome to the podcast. 
 >> Thanks for having me, Lenny. I'm a huge 
 fan of the show and tons of people that 
 I've admired most and learned the most 
 from have been on here. So, it's a crazy 
 moment for me. I'm really excited for 
 this. 
 >> I really appreciate that. I want to 
 start by reading actually a note I got 
 about you from Tal Riv who is a previous 
 podcast guest, many times collaborator, 
 one of the most AI forward product 
 managers that I know. I've learned a ton 
 from him. So, here's what he said about 
 you when he introduced us. Zevy is the 
 most hands-on vibe coding PM I know, and 
 I've personally learned so much from 
 him. His engineers at Meta ask him to 
 teach them how to do what he does. Every 
 time we get coffee, I repeatedly get 
 this feeling of everyone needs to be 
 hearing this. 
 >> That's so nice. 
 >> And so, that's the goal. That's the goal 
 of this conversation is to help more 
 people hear what you figured out. We're 
 going to get very hands-on. Uh we're 
 going to do a lot of show versus tell, 
 showing people what you've figured out 
 about how to be a PM, uh a nontechnical 
 PM building stuff. I want to give people 
 a little bit of background on you 
 because I think this is going to inspire 
 a lot of listeners to feel like they can 
 also do what we're about to show you. Uh 
 this is going to look very advanced, but 
 just give people a little bit of sense 
 of just your background. 
 >> I'm very non-technical. I have zero 
 technical background. Uh did music in 
 high school. Uh a lot of Israelis uh do 
 technology units in the army. I was not 
 in a tech unit. And basically a year 
 ago, I was traveling with my wife uh for 
 3 months in in Asia and we were in 
 Japan. And that was around when Sonnet 
 3.5 came out. And I remember watching a 
 YouTube video uh I think it was either 
 Greg Eisenberg or Riley Brown. And they 
 were basically building uh apps using it 
 was either Bolt or Lovable just using 
 AI. And it was like a crazy moment for 
 me cuz I was watching this and it 
 basically felt like someone came up to 
 me and said, "Hey, Zevie, there's this 
 cool new technology you should check 
 out. Um, you should really give it a 
 try. Oh, and by the way, you have 
 superpowers now." And the second I got 
 home from Japan, I didn't even unpack my 
 bags, ran to my computer, uh, opened 
 Bolt, opened an account, and for the 
 past year, I've been building. And the 
 last thing I'll say on that is we talked 
 about this a bit before we started 
 recording, but I was prepping with 
 Claude for the episode and I was trying 
 to clarify what my goal is for this 
 episode. And Claude said, "If people 
 walk away thinking how amazing you are, 
 you failed. And if people walk away and 
 open their computer and start building, 
 you've succeeded." So I really hope that 
 uh we can inspire some people to do the 
 same. 
 >> Uh I love that so much. I feel like that 
 should be the goal for my podcast. If 
 you're like, I love that guest, it's 
 less of a a win if it's just like, oh, 
 I'm so inspired to do the thing that 
 they figured out. That is the real win. 
 I love cloud is the best. 
 >> I agree. 
 >> Okay, so let's let's uh dive in and give 
 people with let's start with kind of a 
 high level overview of how you operate 
 and use AI in your job. What are the 
 core tools and just what's kind of like 
 the frame of reference for the workflow 
 that you figured out and how you 
 operate? This all started where I was a 
 uh project power user. I love projects 
 um GBD projects. 
 >> GBD projects. 
 >> Yeah, exactly. GBD projects and cloud 
 projects which are basically a shared 
 folder of chats which share both custom 
 instructions and uh shared knowledge 
 base. And I think it was around when GBT 
 started using memory where 
 I thought it was interesting, but it it 
 really annoyed me cuz I do a bunch of 
 different things. Like I'm a terrible 
 runner. Uh I'm a PM. I was a student uh 
 psychology student. So I had all these 
 different facets of life. And what 
 happened was uh the memory feature was 
 mixing stuff up. So like I talked to GBT 
 about running and it would be and it 
 would say oh yeah after this 5K you're 
 going to crush all your next product 
 reviews and it's like ah I mean okay I 
 understand that you have that in your 
 memory but it's just not relevant and 
 projects basically allows you to 
 compartmentalize and and have things 
 within the the right context. So 
 tracking back to the story I told when 
 we came back from Japan I started 
 building this app. Uh the first thing I 
 noticed was that these products were 
 built in a way where and these when I 
 say these products I mean bolt and 
 lovable were built in a way where they 
 were super eager to write code. So their 
 system prompt was you're a coding agent. 
 So when you'd write something they'd 
 straight away start coding. So at the 
 beginning of a project this was super 
 fun and exciting because they just go 
 and start building your app. But later 
 on when things got more complex, this uh 
 created much more problems cuz planning 
 is really important when you're 
 implementing something uh technical and 
 let's say you're implementing payments 
 or something that's going to be uh a 
 change to your database. 
 If the coding agent is just like all 
 right, I got it. And just starts writing 
 code, this always results in terrible 
 things. Uh some really gnarly bugs that 
 I had. And to mitigate this, what I did 
 was I created sort of a CTO. Um so again 
 I'm not technical. I have been in 
 product for a while but I know zero uh 
 zero stuff about code. So basically what 
 I did was I created a CTO with the 
 custom prompt of it. Uh being the 
 complete technical owner of the project. 
 So I told it I own the problem. I own 
 how we want the users to feel. You're 
 the complete owner um of how this is 
 going to be built. I want you to 
 challenge me. I don't want you to be a 
 people pleaser. all these things that 
 kind of mitigate the regular chatbtisms. 
 Uh I I always think about this where for 
 some reason the easiest way for me to 
 think about AI is to imagine it as 
 people and I think ChachiBT would 
 probably be the worst CTO because it's 
 such a people pleaser and it's so 
 sickopantic where 
 I mean just a short story I had uh a few 
 weeks ago I was trying to learn about 
 Bun JavaScript which is uh was acquired 
 by Anthropic and I was trying to 
 understand what they do. So I was 
 talking to GBT and this wasn't within my 
 uh co-founder uh CTO project and I asked 
 it if it's similar to a different 
 framework that I have in my app called 
 Zustand which nothing to do at all with 
 what bun JavaScript does and basically 
 GPT goes oh yeah it's exactly the same 
 and then it started talking about what 
 it what it meant and I was like wait no 
 these are not the same at all and it 
 said like the most terrifying and 
 hilarious thing he goes oh I'm Sorry, I 
 thought you were just making this up and 
 I was riffing with you and I was like, 
 "Oh, no, no, no. This is terrible." So, 
 basically, if regular Chachi PT was a 
 CTO, that would be the CTO who like goes 
 along with your dumbest ideas. So, 
 creating the the project allowed me to 
 mitigate that. 
 >> So, this is um just to just to be super 
 clear, you have a chat GBT project that 
 you've given a prompt to be your CTO of 
 your of your product. And in being a 
 nontechnical person, this is kind of 
 like the thing you talk to when you 
 don't when uh and we'll get to what 
 you're actually using to build when you 
 have questions about architecture and 
 decisions that are technical. 
 >> Yeah. So now I'll show I'll show my full 
 workflow and I don't involve GPT 
 anymore, but I definitely would 
 recommend even though the technology has 
 gone. So when I started this there was 
 no plan mode or ask mode. It was just 
 build on these products on on lovable 
 and bolt and they've progressed a ton. A 
 lot of what I had as workflows have 
 become ingrained in these products which 
 is really interesting. I would still 
 recommend start with a project for first 
 of all the reason that I said and also 
 it kind of puts you in a place where 
 you're in a chatbot and not writing 
 code. So you take the time to converse 
 and to learn which I think is critical. 
 And the second thing is if you're 
 nontechnical like me, code is 
 terrifying. It's the scariest thing in 
 the world to look at. And I look at it 
 as kind of like exposure therapy. I 
 think if you see this where I'm working 
 like in uh Claude or in cursor, you 
 might be excited to start using those, 
 but I would really recommend starting 
 slow uh with a GPT project. Um beautiful 
 UI, super simple. then maybe graduate to 
 like a bolt or a lovable and then go to 
 cursor in light mode slowly slowly 
 gradually ease in until you like open a 
 terminal uh you know go full dark mode 
 go full dev um so I would really 
 recommend doing this gradually 
 >> that is awesome advice and so just to be 
 uh to be clear these days you're using 
 cursor with cloud code powering it and 
 what I love about that is that you're 
 not you've never written code you the 
 way you put it you're afraid of even 
 looking at code you have to do 
 >> expos exposure therapy and I love that 
 cursor is is useful to you and what 
 you're telling us is that graduating 
 from a chatbt project that is kind of 
 your technical co-founder kind of taught 
 you enough to feel more comfortable 
 going straight to cursor. You you said 
 that you actually went to boulder in 
 lovable kind of in the interim uh and 
 then you went to just straight to 
 cursor. What's the reason to just go 
 straight to cursor? Just curs is it just 
 cursor has cursor can do everything and 
 once you get the hang of it it's 
 actually the most powerful tool. Yeah, I 
 think I graduated from each tool when I 
 kind of outgrew it. So, Bolt was awesome 
 until I was trying to connect payments 
 to my app and it kind of started losing 
 it and then I graduated to Cursor and 
 I've actually fallen in love with 
 Claude. Uh, so I'm using Claude code, 
 but that also runs within Cursor and I 
 think this is Tal uh who told me this. 
 I'm not sure who he's quoting. Uh, but 
 code is just words at the end of the 
 day. Um, so it's just files on your 
 computer. So basically you can be 
 working on the same project and carry it 
 from app to app and especially now I can 
 work on with multiple models and apps on 
 my project. So start slow but uh 
 definitely there's there's a lot of 
 places you can graduate too. 
 >> Awesome. Okay. Should we dive into u 
 screen share showing how you operate? 
 >> Awesome. I pulled up cursor. Can you see 
 it? 
 >> Perfect. So within my codebase what you 
 can see here on the left these are all 
 my code files. Uh here on the right is 
 cursor. Uh so this is basically like 
 having AI which has access to all the 
 code. And here in the middle I have 
 cloud code running. And what you can see 
 here I'm going to close cursor for a 
 second. What you can see here are all my 
 slash commands. Basically what slash 
 commands are they are reusable prompts 
 that I save within the codebase that I 
 can run by writing slash and then the 
 name of the file. So here you can see 
 create issue which is the first command 
 that I'm going to use. And basically 
 what this tells Claude, it says the user 
 is mid development and thought of a bug 
 or a feature and improvement. Capture it 
 fast so they can keep working. And then 
 it basically says this is the format 
 that I want you to capture the the U 
 linear issue in. And it explains a bunch 
 of things what exactly cloud needs to do 
 to get there. So the way I invoke this 
 is basically I'll do slash 
 create issue 
 and this injects this prompt into 
 claude. So it says, uh, I'm ready to 
 help you to capture this issue. What's 
 on your mind? So basically when I'll do 
 this is if I'm working on a big project 
 and I suddenly come across a bug or have 
 an idea that I don't want to work on 
 right now, but I want to work on later, 
 I'll do this really quick. And Claude's 
 main goal is to quickly capture what I'm 
 thinking about. So quickly to run 
 through my full workflow. So basically, 
 it starts with creating an issue. So 
 this is uh the create issue slash 
 command which basically tells claude 
 that I'm mid development and it should 
 quickly capture what I'm thinking about 
 and create an issue within linear. Then 
 later on uh when I want to pick this up 
 I have the exploration phase. 
 Exploration phase is basically telling 
 claude we're going to only explore what 
 we want to solve here. It could either 
 pull from linear or I can just speak 
 freely to it. And what it will do is it 
 will analyze and understand the issue 
 and just ask clarifying questions. The 
 next phase after we've done finished 
 exploration phase is we're going to 
 create a plan. So you can see create 
 plan. This basically has a template that 
 I love for creating a plans and the 
 output of this at the end of the day 
 will be a markdown file with our plan 
 that we can end up building along with 
 code. After creating the plan we have 
 execute plan. After execution we have 
 review and then we have peer review 
 which is really cool and we'll get into 
 later on. Um and at the end we update 
 the docs. So this is updating 
 documentation and everything so that 
 agents can write better code later on. 
 So I think what we'll do is we're going 
 to build a feature live for my app which 
 I think is really cool. But first what 
 I'd like to do is is show you the app so 
 you have some context. So this is 
 Studymate. It's a platform for students 
 which allows them to upload um study 
 materials and create uh interactive 
 tests based on their own materials. So 
 here we can go to the top. Uh let's 
 upload a PDF. 
 We can decide what pages we want to be 
 quizzed on. We can decide the number of 
 questions, the difficulty level. And 
 basically what happens behind the scenes 
 is we send the information the user 
 uploaded along with the system prompt 
 and any other um augmentations the 
 user's decided to uh Gemini and we 
 create a quiz. These are uh challenging 
 questions that are meant to assess 
 comprehension. You even have some hints. 
 And once we do a few of these, we can 
 submit. 
 >> I got them right. 
 >> Terrible results. 
 >> Yeah. 
 >> And so and so just to be really clear 
 about this, this is like a side business 
 that you have, an app that you built 
 that's making money. That's just like a 
 thing you vibe coded having no 
 >> technical. This is my weekend project. 
 Yeah. This is what I do uh on weekends. 
 Um, yeah. So, you get basically deep 
 explanations into why each uh question 
 was wrong or each question was right. 
 And at the moment, Studymate only has 
 multiple choice questions. And I was 
 doing some competitor research over over 
 the last weekend and I saw competitors 
 who had true or false questions and also 
 fill in the blank questions, which I 
 loved. So, I think that'd be really cool 
 if we could uh build that live. How's 
 that? 
 >> I love it. I'm crossing crossing our 
 fingers. This all work. Uh I just want I 
 I just want to highlight the stuff you 
 shared right before this incursor. So 
 this is a huge deal what you described 
 here. This is essentially what you've 
 figured out is a way as a non a person 
 that has no idea how to write any code 
 how to build a product in cursor as a 
 product manager using this series of 
 slash commands that you've concocted 
 that you're going to be sharing with 
 listeners. They can download all these 
 and just use them directly. They don't 
 have to figure out all these prompts 
 that you've you've figured out. 
 >> Yeah, 100%. Basically what happened was 
 I formulated the backbone of this uh 
 with the CTO and it was basically within 
 the system prompt of the CTO project 
 that I had within GBT. Uh so it said 
 step one we do this, step two we do this 
 and now I'll keep building and if I see 
 something that happens over and over 
 again I'll just create a slash command 
 and then it will be automated within the 
 workflow. 
 >> Amazing. So just to summarize the slash 
 commands. So one is create an issue in 
 linear which uh I love. Linear is 
 awesome. Shout out. 
 >> That's also from uh yeah the product 
 pass. 
 >> From the product pass there. Oh my god, 
 what value. Uh okay. So step one is 
 create the issue in linear. So it's a 
 command. So this prompt slashcomand 
 you've created. Just create issue. Then 
 it's explorer which is uh explore the 
 idea. Help me ideate on what this could 
 be. And this is Claude helping you think 
 through the feature and product. Then 
 it's actually create the plan. And so 
 it's like the AI helping you build the 
 plan to build the product. 
 >> Then it's actually execute which is just 
 build the thing. 
 >> Yeah. 
 >> And then there's this review peer review 
 step which is awesome that uh you'll 
 share. And then there's document update 
 documentation based on this new feature 
 that we're adding. 
 >> Sweet. 
 >> Yeah. Cool. So let's uh go ahead and 
 start building. So I'm going to use 
 whisperflow uh to dictate. And basically 
 this starts with slash create issue. 
 Um, so this basically sends that prompt 
 and I love this because I usually do 
 this uh during when I'm building 
 something else. So basically it tells 
 Claude that I'm mid building something 
 and I don't have a lot of time to to to 
 waste time on this. So just ask some 
 brief questions so that you have enough 
 to capture within linear. So I want to 
 add fill-in- thelank questions to 
 Studymate. Uh, I want this to be 30% of 
 tests to be generated as fill-in- 
 thelank questions. I want there to be 
 six potential answers uh for two blank 
 spots. And of course, there's only going 
 to be two correct answers. So, one 
 correct answer and two incorrect answers 
 for each spot. And I want the interface 
 to be drag and drop. So, that's just 
 basically uh a quick think of of of how 
 I want this to work. 
 So, it's going to ask me a few 
 questions. Quizzes are 100% multiple 
 choice. Question structure, single 
 sentence, pass through two blanks. Um, 
 and priority. So, one and two are 
 correct. And this is uh not high 
 priority. Uh, it's a nice to have 
 feature. 
 So now basically what claude is going to 
 do is it's going to use MCP which is 
 basically uh uh technology that was 
 created by anthropic which gives AI the 
 ability to use tools. So this is 
 connected to my linear. So what it's 
 going to do now is it's going to use 
 everything we've said and create an 
 issue within linear. And by the way as 
 as this is loading I just love the way 
 the way you describe this especially 
 doing voice mode. It's like exactly how 
 you would talk to an engineer describing 
 a feature. Here's what I want and then 
 they ask you questions. Here's the 
 clarification. 
 >> Yeah. So, at first when I was doing this 
 with the CTO, I would do it with uh chat 
 voice mode and that was crazy. That was 
 like literally felt like ideulating with 
 a person. Um it would push back, ask 
 questions and maybe one day, you know, 
 the coding uh tools will get there too. 
 But that was exactly it really felt like 
 sitting with my CTO. Um great. So 
 created STU88. So if we open up linear 
 now we should be able to see 
 uh let's see where SU88 there it is. Uh 
 fill in the blank questions with drag 
 and drop interface. So it has a TLDDR. 
 It has the current state. It did a 
 little bit of research on the codebase I 
 think. Um expected outcomes some 
 context. So yeah. So this is basically 
 ready for me to pick up when I'm 
 interested in building. So now let's say 
 a few days go by. I finished the current 
 project I'm working on. I can pick it 
 up. So when I pick it up, I do 
 slashexploration phase, which is what we 
 said. And then instead of pressing 
 enter, I'll press tab. And I'll show you 
 this. So basically exploration phase. 
 What it does is it will take an 
 argument. This is basically a 
 placeholder within the prompt which 
 allows me to enter something that is 
 extra context for the for the AI. So I 
 can say here linear 
 stu 
 88 which is referencing the ticket and 
 now what it's going to do is it's going 
 to go it's going to fetch the linear 
 ticket 
 >> and what's the idea what's the goal of 
 the exploration phase this is kind of 
 idea is that the idea 
 >> so it's it's both for the CTO to deeply 
 understand the problem that we're trying 
 to solve and also understand the current 
 state of the codebase what files need to 
 be affected and how is the best way to 
 implement this technically. Um, and 
 usually what happens is right now 
 Claude's just basically reading a bunch 
 of files understanding the basic uh 
 structure of the code and then it's 
 going to come back with a bunch of 
 clarifying questions as uh that will 
 decide how we end up implementing this. 
 >> So it's like it feels like it's talking 
 to your engineering manager. 
 >> Exactly. Exactly. 100% this is this is 
 how I think about it. 
 >> And you said that your CTO so you used 
 to use JBT prompt uh to have a CTO in 
 there. how the CTO is living inside here 
 in cursor. 
 >> Yeah, because of the way the tools have 
 developed um and they've become so good 
 at both exploration and code execution. 
 So now it's it's just uh kind of a habit 
 that I call it a CTO, but it's basically 
 allin-one. The the same agent will will 
 both do the exploration and write the 
 plan and end up executing the code. 
 >> Got it. So it's basically it's clock 
 code. Is there like a prompt you gave it 
 to act like that to act like the right 
 kind of CTO? 
 >> Yeah. So within uh the claude MD which 
 is basically the system prompt that's uh 
 loaded within claude's context in every 
 conversation I have uh some basic stuff 
 like this is our workflow this is how we 
 work within exploration phase I want you 
 to challenge my thinking all kinds of 
 stuff like that that can be loaded yeah 
 within the uh claude MD file 
 >> cool one last question before before we 
 move on here just because it's I'm 
 thinking about it as this happens the 
 linear issue that you generated how 
 often is it is it actually great and 
 ready. How often do you have to edit it? 
 What's like the quality of the linear 
 ticket that it generates? Cuz you know, 
 a lot of people are like probably 
 wondering just like all these terrible 
 linear issues are being created by AI. 
 Are they actually any good? It's 
 completely different because I'm a 
 company of one. So, uh, a lot of the 
 context is within here and there's no 
 need for me to like talk to other teams 
 and understand. It's basically very 
 accessible and also I can easily see 
 when uh Claude understood something uh 
 wrong. I don't want to say that I would 
 create linear issues at work like this. 
 Uh but definitely if you're building 
 your own side project, it's uh they're 
 they're pretty quality and also it just 
 kicks off the the when I want to start 
 working on it. It's not I wouldn't say 
 it's ready to be built. It's ready to 
 start being explored. 
 >> Got it. So it's just the beginning of an 
 idea. Actually, let's come back after we 
 go through this flow of how you would 
 approach this if you were at say Meta or 
 another maybe a smaller company. how 
 this workflow might work at a larger 
 company that isn't just a your own 
 startup. 
 >> Yeah, interesting. Let's come back to 
 that. 
 >> Um, cool. All right, so this is Claude 
 coming back. I have a comprehensive 
 understanding of the codebase. Um, I 
 thoroughly end and uh analyze studymate 
 live codebase and understand the current 
 system, feature quest, and key areas 
 that it's identified. Um, usually I'd 
 spend a lot of time going over this 
 because this is super super important, 
 but just for the sake of development 
 right now, we're going to brush through 
 this. Now, Claude basically comes back 
 after it's gone through the codebase and 
 and understood the way it currently 
 works. It's basically telling me what 
 the current understanding is. So, it's 
 talking about how the app is set up at 
 the moment, uh, how the data is 
 structured, what it understood from the 
 feature request, and what's it what it's 
 it has identified as key areas. And then 
 it asked me some questions. So it's 
 asking about the scope. It's asking 
 about the data model, the UX UI of the 
 feature, how it should be validated, how 
 it should be graded, what changes need 
 to be happen to the AI system prompt, 
 and all kinds of questions about the 
 app. I've prepared answers to all these 
 questions beforehand because I don't 
 think we all want to sit through this. 
 So I'm just going to paste that in, and 
 we'll see what Claude says. 
 >> Awesome. I love it. And I love just just 
 scanning those questions I was asking. 
 It's like such smart, sophisticated, 
 important questions instead of just 
 cool, here I go. I'm gonna build it. 
 >> Yeah. And I think this is the big um 
 difference between like just vibe coding 
 and going along with the vibes and 
 really building serious apps. I spend a 
 lot a lot of time going back and forth 
 and understanding. Also a very cool uh 
 slash command that I haven't showed yet 
 is uh learning opportunity which 
 basically when something is really 
 difficult for me to understand I'll uh 
 do slasharning opportunity and then talk 
 about what I want to learn. And this 
 basically primes Claude and says I am a 
 technical PM in the making. I have 
 mid-level engineering knowledge. I 
 understand architect uh architecture and 
 basically I want you to explain what 
 we're currently working on uh using the 
 8020 rule. So this is a great way to 
 learn. I would definitely take this and 
 every time you kind of see something 
 that you don't fully understand, I would 
 definitely use this uh to learn. Great. 
 So Claude basically comes back and says 
 uh how it understands the current uh 
 data model and how it's going to 
 implement. Uh yeah, so it's ready to 
 create the plan. So basically what I'm 
 going to do now is I'm going to go and 
 do slashcreate plan. 
 And while Claude's doing this, I'm going 
 to show really quick what this looks 
 like. So, basically, 
 these plans are from a template that I 
 found on Twitter. Uh, I forgot who it 
 was, but it was just a template that 
 really resonated with me. And it's 
 basically saying, um, based on our 
 exchange, create a markdown file that 
 will be the plan. Um, include clear, 
 minimal, concise steps. Track the 
 status. So, this basically has like 
 status trackers on each task that Claude 
 updates as it's going through and it 
 will have a TLDDR, some critical 
 decisions that we've made and the plan 
 itself. So, Claude's uh finished writing 
 the plan. So, we'll be able to look and 
 see exactly what the plan is. So, it has 
 a TLDDR. It has the critical decisions 
 we've made and the tasks broken down. 
 Um, and this is a perfect plan and it's 
 also a really good way to write this 
 because a lot of times I'll use 
 different models to execute certain 
 stuff. So, cursor has an amazing model 
 called composer which is super fast. Uh, 
 so a lot of things that are not that um 
 complex, I'll use uh composer. Gemini 3 
 that just came out is unbelievable at 
 UI. So, a lot of times I'll split the 
 plan into backend and front end and then 
 I'll have Gemini just read the plan and 
 do the front end. Um so having this as a 
 markdown file is really good and also 
 going forward it's really good to have 
 within the app so that um later on if an 
 agent is writing code in a certain area 
 it can see what's already been done 
 there. 
 Um so what we're going to do now is 
 we're going to execute the plan. So now 
 I think we're going to do this with 
 cursor just because uh composer is so 
 freaking fast. So what we can do is 
 basically just say execute 
 and then we can tag the file and 
 composer is ridiculously fast. So that's 
 it. It's off. It basically understands 
 what the plan is and it's going to go 
 ahead and start writing the code. 
 >> Let me ask you a question while this is 
 happening and also I have many questions 
 so this is a good time to ask a few of 
 them. You said that lovable and bolt are 
 and other you know other apps in that 
 space are are just not enough to build 
 really serious apps and you had to move 
 to cursor to do that. What tell us more 
 about that just like how far what what's 
 kind of limitation you ran into with 
 those products and why you switched to 
 cursor. 
 >> I started using cursor and cloud code a 
 few months ago and I haven't looked back 
 but at that time these teams have been 
 moving like crazy. So, I don't want to 
 say I wouldn't trust them. I don't know 
 what the current state is, but for me, 
 it was basically the issue of I felt 
 that CL that Bolt was being very 
 opinionated on how I should do things 
 and I felt like my knowledge has gotten 
 to a point where I can graduate and be 
 more in control. By the way, I think 
 that the main difference between all 
 these tools is basically the harness. 
 So, the models are all the same models. 
 You know, I I'll run Claude within 
 Cursor. I'll run it within Cloud Code. 
 And it's also the models that claude is 
 also the model that is underlying bolt 
 and lovable. But basically bolt and 
 lovable will add a bunch of levels in 
 the middle that will take all kind of 
 guesswork and and and hard decisions out 
 for the user. So the user doesn't make 
 have to make these hard decisions. So 
 it's also very easy to build. But the 
 flip side of that is that you have less 
 control. And basically claude code is 
 just taking claude and shoving it 
 straight in your code system and giving 
 it full tools and to do whatever it 
 wants. But also with that comes a lot of 
 decisions that you need to make. So I 
 don't know if if you can't build really 
 amazing production apps using using bolt 
 or lovable now but I think basically if 
 you want the most cutting edge abilities 
 of the models and you want to be able to 
 make all the decisions uh on your own 
 it's probably best to be on one of these 
 tools. What I'm feeling and hearing is 
 that planning work that you did. That's 
 the stuff that lovable, bold, and would 
 you put replet in that bucket, too? 
 >> Yeah, for sure. Lovable, bold, replet, 
 base 44, 
 >> v 0. 
 >> Um, yeah, v 0 all same bucket. 
 >> So, essentially, they're kind of they're 
 doing that planning for you. And as you 
 said, they're very opinionated. They 
 they try to make it easy. So, it's just 
 like here's how to do it. We're not 
 going to like here's the way we want to 
 we think is best for people. And what 
 you're saying is once you're trying to 
 get a more serious about it or have want 
 to go in a different direction, you 
 don't have the power to change the how 
 they plan. So cursor lets you do that. 
 >> Yeah. I don't want this to come out like 
 I'm badmouthing them. Base 44, let's 
 say. 
 >> Yeah. Yeah. Base 44 does an amazing job 
 at basically taking all the complex 
 guesswork out of building product and 
 just allows you to just, you know, go 
 with the vibes and build, but it will do 
 signin with Google for you and it will 
 do a database, but then you don't have 
 decisions on uh what database am I 
 using? Do I need sign in with Google 
 this way or the or another way? It would 
 just do it out of the box. So, so that's 
 basically the trade-off there. 
 >> Awesome. Shout out Mayor, the uh founder 
 of Basically Podcast. Yep. 
 >> Yeah, he's amazing. 
 >> Uh I just love how this is like the way 
 you're like uh flinging what's the word? 
 Slinging slinging models like Gemini 3 
 for front end. Like I love that you have 
 you've never written any code and you're 
 just like cool, we use Gemini for this 
 and cloud for this and I'm just working 
 on cursor talking to this uh CTO helping 
 you build stuff and build like 
 significant product. Yeah, I mean we 
 just live in the craziest of times where 
 basically there the world changes once a 
 week. Uh it feels like and there is just 
 no boundaries. You can you can use all 
 of these just on your like regular 
 MacBook or regular laptop. And I have 
 these moments um I call them time 
 machine moments which is basically this 
 week for instance I was prepping for the 
 podcast using claude with a project. I 
 was building I was fully localizing uh 
 studymate from Hebrew to English which I 
 did in two days which would probably 
 take a dev team weeks and I was building 
 a personal site which went from no 
 domain no nothing to live uh on a domain 
 within an hour and a half. And I was 
 doing all three of these in parallel. 
 And there was a point where basically 
 all three of the agents were running. So 
 I didn't have anything to do. I just had 
 to let them think. And these are like 
 the time machine moments where I feel 
 like I was in the future and I just 
 stick my head out of the time machine 
 and whoever's next to me, like at the 
 moment it was my wife, I'll just say we 
 we live in the future. And she'll be 
 like, "Huh? What?" And I'll be like, 
 "No, no, don't worry about it." But it's 
 just basically so crazy that all these 
 things are just, you know, an API away. 
 you can you can use anything. So, I 
 think it's an awesome time to be curious 
 and uh optimistic and hardworking. 
 >> These are my favorite kinds of podcast 
 guests, people that are living in the 
 future, figuring out all these things, 
 and then are just kind of come back, as 
 you said, pok your head out of the the 
 rocket ship and just like, hey, here's 
 this thing that I figured out. Here's 
 where we're going. 
 >> Yeah. Best time to be alive. 
 >> Um, so awesome. So, it looks like it's 
 finished. Um, so now what we're going to 
 do is we're going to run the app locally 
 and we'll be able to see uh what uh 
 Composer ended up building and we're 
 going to see if anything else is needed 
 um on our end to maybe do some manual 
 review. Does that sound good? 
 >> Sounds great. And I love that was like I 
 don't know few minutes where if it was a 
 human engineer it would be like days 
 maybe a week work. 
 >> Yeah, for sure. No. Uh, composer like 
 the one thing is it's just so so blazing 
 fast. Keeps you in flow. Uh, so yeah, 
 full features take u minutes 
 >> and that probably cost like a couple 
 bucks in AI credits. 
 >> I don't even look I mean I used to be so 
 stingy about paying for products and now 
 I'm just basically I look at it all as 
 tuition, you know, as like uh stuff that 
 I'm paying for learning. Uh so I don't 
 know how much it costs but it's 
 definitely worth it. That explains why 
 they're the fastest growing products in 
 history. Oh,

 >> So now we have uh this feature which 
 basically we built um and I can ask it 
 to make some changes because it's 
 running locally. Um and once it's ready 
 I'll be able to ship it to users. So now 
 the next phase after I've uh qed it and 
 basically tested it manually, I'll have 
 Claude review its own work. Um so what 
 I'll do is I'll uh reopen Claude Code. I 
 love this because this is one of the 
 things that comes up a lot on this 
 podcast is writing code is now so easy. 
 The main challenge people have is 
 reviewing the code that AI has written. 
 And what you're doing here is you're 
 having Claude review its own code. 
 >> Yeah. So this is another thing where 
 it's very difficult for me to catch 
 mistakes. So my review process has gone 
 through a bunch of iterations to really 
 be uh as good as possible and to catch 
 as many things as possible. So, I'll 
 always manual manually QA it first uh to 
 make sure if I can see any mistakes that 
 Claude made and then what I'll do is 
 basically slash review. 
 And this uh tells Claude to start 
 reviewing its own code. But what's even 
 cooler and something that I'm really 
 proud of is I will usually do multiple 
 reviews and I'll have codeex which is 
 chat GBT's competitor to cloud code as 
 well as cursor open and I will have each 
 of them review the code and then what 
 what I do is I have a slash command 
 called peer review which is really 
 interesting and basically what it does 
 is it's going to take claude which is 
 usually the agent who I'm work working 
 with. And just to put this in a mental 
 model, this is basically my uh my dev 
 lead that I'm working with. I will take 
 uh the the slash command is basically 
 saying you're the dev lead on this 
 project. Other team leads within the 
 company have looked at your code and 
 reviewed it and found these issues. 
 Don't take what they're what they said 
 at face value. The reason is you have 
 more context than them and you led this 
 project. you need to either um explain 
 why the stuff they found are not real 
 issues and wrong or fix them yourself. 
 And it's really cool because the way I 
 look at these things is I look at the 
 models. I try to imagine them as people 
 and I can I can really tell you how each 
 one of these uh would be as as a real 
 human. Um because they have yeah each 
 model has such distinct uh 
 characteristics. So let's say Claude, 
 she would be the perfect CTO. like she's 
 very communicative. She's very smart. Um 
 she she doesn't just go with the flow 
 and do whatever you tell her. She's very 
 um opinionated, but also super 
 collaborative, which is I think why I'm 
 always drawn to Claude. Um because I I 
 need to do so much learning and and like 
 it's it's your dream, a very 
 communicative but very um opinionated uh 
 dev lead. But then there's also Codeex. 
 So I use Codeex um 5.1 Max, whatever. 
 had another not the best at naming uh 
 models but GPT's model I always imagine 
 it as like a the best coder within the 
 company who comes to the office like 
 with uh a hoodie and sandals and sits in 
 a dark room and you basically only 
 bother him when you have the worst bugs 
 and you say listen we have this bug and 
 it will just close the door for two 
 hours and come out and say I fixed it 
 and you're like wait what are you gonna 
 tell us what happened or what he's like 
 don't worry about it I fixed it it's 
 like really not communicative but it 
 solves all the worst problems. And let's 
 say Gemini is like a crazy scientist 
 who's super artsy, uh, super talented at 
 designing, but if you sit next to it and 
 watch it work, it's terrifying. Like, 
 you would fire that person instantly. 
 This might be just my experience, but 
 when I'm using Gemini within 
 anti-gravity, which is uh Google's new 
 competitor to cursor, when it's writing 
 code, you can see the steps it's taking, 
 and it's terrifying. like you'll say, 
 uh, I want you to redesign the top of 
 the dashboard and and you're looking at 
 its thought process and it will say, oh, 
 first things first, I'll delete the 
 dashboard. And then it'll be like, nope, 
 that was a mistake. I'll bring it back. 
 And then it will say, oh, can I edit the 
 database? And you're like, no, do not 
 edit the database. You're just doing a 
 redesign. And then it will end up 
 designing something beautiful. Um, so 
 the like the way there is like a roller 
 coaster and very scary, but at the end 
 of the day, Gemini is very good at 
 design. So I think that using all these 
 models um and basically playing to their 
 strengths and mitigating their 
 weaknesses by using other models is is a 
 game changer for me. So I'll do peer 
 review a bunch of times and and I'll 
 have other models review other models 
 code and kind of have them like fight it 
 out. Uh basically like sometimes uh 
 cloud code will get really sassy and be 
 like this has been raised for the third 
 time and for the third time I'm telling 
 you this is not an issue. This is by 
 design. So, it's just a really cool cool 
 uh thing that I've added and I haven't 
 seen many people doing it. 
 >> That is such an incredible rant slash 
 way to understand what's going on. Okay, 
 awesome. So, we just ran the review. So, 
 show us what we saw there and let's 
 actually try this peer review. I'm 
 really excited to see what what you 
 learned there. 
 >> Yeah, so basically Claude has reviewed 
 its code and it's found a bunch of bugs. 
 A critical bug it found in the prompt. 
 uh some high bugs, some medium bugs. And 
 now what I'll do is I'll do the same 
 thing with the other models. So Codeex 
 has a built-in code review that you can 
 do or I just like to say review uh all 
 the code in this branch. 
 Of course, branch is referring to the 
 GitHub branch that we're working on. Uh 
 we're not working on the live codebase. 
 And then I'll do this with composer. Say 
 with we can do let's do it with with 
 composer one. So, I'll do uh slash 
 review here as well. And basically, 
 these are both going to run and do a 
 in-depth review similar to what claw 
 does. But again, because of the 
 differences between the models, uh 
 they're all going to catch different 
 things and they're all going to look 
 differently. And this is a really cool 
 way to work. It's basically if you had 
 other team leads within the company uh 
 review the code. Here you can see how 
 fast composer is. I think GPT probably 
 will take a bunch of time. Like I said, 
 it's in its own dark room right now 
 reviewing code and we'll come back in a 
 few minutes. 
 >> Okay, cool. So, we could we could let 
 these run and we don't actually have to 
 go through the whole process. But is the 
 idea once you get these results, you run 
 peer review and you you copy and paste 
 kind of these results. Is that that 
 >> exactly? I'll copy and paste the 
 results. I'll do peer review and then 
 I'll say dev lead one and then paste 
 from one of the models and then I'll say 
 dev lead two and paste from the other 
 model and basically have them uh fight 
 it out until I feel like we have no more 
 issues. Um, for me, this is super 
 important because I'm not a I'm not 
 technical and I'm not a developer. And 
 I'll also use slasharning opportunity a 
 bunch during this to learn about stuff 
 that I don't understand or or don't 
 fully grasp. 
 >> Incredible. What a what a clever 
 solution to solving this code review 
 problem where it's like I don't know 
 what you're I don't I don't know how to 
 recode, so what am I going to even Yeah. 
 >> Yeah. 
 >> Okay. Incredible. Let's uh let's wrap up 
 this kind of this workflow. Is there 
 anything else that's important in this 
 workflow? And again, all this stuff is 
 going to be available where people can 
 just plug this stuff into their cursor 
 account and and use it themselves 
 >> 100%. Um, the one thing I'll say is that 
 I think just like working in general 
 with AI and even just like uh working on 
 any product doing constant post-mortems 
 is critical. So a lot of times we'll 
 find all these kind of bugs or maybe 
 Claude will fail to execute something 
 correctly. And at the beginning when I 
 started vibe coding, I would basically 
 just keep running at it like running at 
 the wall and until it worked. And once 
 it worked, I was like, "All right, 
 awesome. This works. Let's keep going." 
 But I've learned over time that updating 
 documentation and tooling is one of the 
 biggest hacks for productivity. So when 
 Claude will fail to do something or I'll 
 see this really bad bug that that shows 
 that Claude really didn't understand 
 something, I'll ask it what in your 
 system prompt or tooling made you make 
 this mistake and cloud will kind of like 
 go introspective and think of what made 
 it do create that mistake and then I'll 
 say okay great let's update your tooling 
 and documentation so that this mistake 
 never occurs again and I do this every 
 time I'm either building uh an internal 
 tool or anything and I I think this is 
 just like working, you know, if you've 
 you end up doing a bunch of mistakes and 
 then end up releasing the feature to 
 users. So, you're like, "All right, it's 
 a big success." But going back and even 
 when you've succeeded, um looking and 
 understanding what you did and what you 
 could have done better is critical. And 
 also using AI, this is probably one of 
 the biggest unlocks. Going back to your 
 prompts, understanding what was not good 
 enough, iterating on them, and then 
 seeing how AI's responses get better. I 
 think that's probably one of the most 
 important things and one of the things 
 that divides between people who are like 
 okay with using AI and the people who 
 actually know how to use it. 
 >> That is such good advice. So what I'm 
 hearing is when you run in when the 
 models do something dumb, make a 
 mistake, you ask it to reflect on what 
 the mistake it made was and then you 
 update the slash command prompts uh with 
 that knowledge so that in the future 
 it's not making that same mistake and it 
 just keeps getting better. These things 
 just keep getting smarter and smarter. 
 you're building up this really 
 incredible prompt that just gets better 
 and better. 
 >> Exactly. Um, not always the slash 
 commands. It will sometimes update uh 
 different documentation or its tooling, 
 but basically it's it's understanding 
 what the root cause of the of the uh 
 mistake that the AI AI made and fixing 
 it. 
 >> Awesome. So, it's not so like the models 
 are getting smarter and then there's 
 also the other parts of your workflow 
 can get smarter as you as you find flaws 
 in the way of stuff. 
 >> 100%. Yep. 
 >> Amazing. Okay. Um, is there anything 
 else there before I move in a couple 
 other directions? 
 >> I think that's it. I think we covered 
 pretty much everything. Basically, just 
 to wrap this up, what I do is I do a 
 bunch of code review and then update the 
 documentation so that everything is 
 documented so the next time I try to 
 build a feature in this area, there 
 won't be any mistakes. Um, and then I'll 
 do a bunch of testing. I'll do some user 
 testing as well before I release this to 
 general availability. Obviously, we're 
 not going to release this. This was just 
 a show. Uh, but hopefully maybe by the 
 time the podcast comes out, I'll I'll 
 have done this correctly and and release 
 the feature. 
 >> It's incredible that this was not 
 possible like I don't know two years 
 ago, maybe a year ago. Like you are a 
 product manager shipping a product 
 without knowing how to write code, 
 barely knowing how to review code. You 
 said you're afraid of looking at code. 
 As a product manager, you're building a 
 product in cursor using uh all of these 
 different AI models. You're making money 
 with this product. Uh this is like we're 
 so used to this now, but it's insane 
 what is now possible. 
 >> It's the best time to be alive 100%. Um 
 I think that I I understand the fear, 
 but AI just makes so much possible. Just 
 a quick uh side note here, my brother, 
 who I'm building one of the apps with, 
 is an entrepreneur. He has a beautiful 
 business that helps old people um and 
 seniors understand to use technology and 
 uh AI better. and he's basically doing 
 the same kind of learning as me and he's 
 replaced all of the tools he was paying 
 for. I think he was paying for Zapier 
 and Air Table and he's basically built 
 uh like a full-fledged CRM system and 
 automation system for his business 
 completely alone. So, I mean for the 
 people who are curious um optimistic, 
 hardworking, this is the best time to be 
 to be a builder. And what I love about 
 this conversation we're having here is 
 it feels like the biggest barrier for a 
 lot of people is like how do I get 
 started? What exactly do I do? I open up 
 cursor. It looks very intimidating. I 
 don't know how to write code. I don't 
 know how to build stuff. I don't know 
 about databases. And so you're going to 
 be sharing all these slash commands and 
 basically this whole workflow with the 
 audience. 
 >> Yeah. Okay. And like I said, just start 
 at GPT. Start in GPT. Um tell it what 
 your idea is. Uh tell it to explain to 
 you what are even the first steps of 
 thinking. what are the decisions you 
 need to make and just be like be 
 inquisitive learn um don't rush things 
 uh it's very important to just dive in 
 and and really spend the time to learn 
 >> and you share this one of your slash 
 commands is learning opportunity and 
 it's how you learn a lot of these things 
 just like teach me this thing of how 
 this database issue works 
 >> exactly 
 >> okay there's a couple directions I want 
 to make sure we touch on one is coming 
 back to a question I asked earlier about 
 how this might work at a larger company 
 say it's not like Meta but just like I 
 don't know a thousand person company, 
 500 people. How much of this can you 
 plug and play into a workflow as a PM at 
 a larger company? What would be your 
 advice for someone that may want to 
 start trying to ship code at least 
 showing people what's possible? 
 >> I think that first making your codebase 
 AI native is a really important step and 
 I think this needs to be done by 
 technical people. So basically my 
 codebase has a ton of just plain text in 
 it. So it will have a bunch of markdown 
 files that explain to agents how to work 
 in certain areas of the codebase um and 
 highle structure so that the agents uh 
 navigate through the codebase easier. 
 And I think that if this is set up in a 
 really good way, I still don't think uh 
 like PMS should be shipping heavy uh 
 database chain migrations or any like 
 big project. But you know, contained UI 
 uh projects, especially if you just 
 build it, create the PR and and send it 
 to a dev to like do the final finishes. 
 Uh I think that's definitely something 
 that's possible. And I think we're going 
 to see that a lot in the next coming 
 years. I think basically everyone's 
 going to become a builder. So should be 
 really interesting. 
 >> Okay. So your advice here is as a PM 
 don't maybe don't go to cursor start 
 building shipping trying to ship 
 features to production especially 
 complicated features. Do you think we'll 
 get there? Do you think like in a couple 
 years PMs will be doing this and it'll 
 feel less scary and crazy. 
 >> If there are PMs um 
 >> yeah I think titles are going to 
 collapse and responsibilities are going 
 to collapse and everyone's just going to 
 be building. Um, I definitely think that 
 the models the context window is getting 
 bigger, the models are getting smarter. 
 Um, and I definitely see how PMS or any 
 other background can be writing. At the 
 moment, I wouldn't wait for that. I 
 would use this as a collaborative 
 learning opportunity to work with your 
 dev team. It's going to be difficult. A 
 lot of developers are very very skeptic 
 about the current state and I think that 
 it's going to be a lot of sales work on 
 your end to convince. But if you're able 
 to convince and I think teams that are 
 really sold on this and want to take the 
 time to work on their workflow about how 
 can our a team become more AI native, I 
 think that these teams are going to 
 probably be a few years in the future 
 and they're going to look back at the 
 few weeks they spent setting this up as 
 as the best time they spent. Let me ask 
 you another question around just the job 
 of a PM. One of the biggest fears people 
 have with these AI tools for for PMs for 
 every function I imagine is just they 
 you start to rely on these things. Your 
 skills start to atrophy. You're 
 producing all this slop that looks 
 great. Cool. Amazing strategy doc. Now 
 it's actually not at all good. Or these 
 linear tickets or just products that are 
 like halfbaked. What's your take on kind 
 of these two parts of just like how has 
 this impacted your uh craft as a PM? Do 
 you feel like this has weakening your 
 skills because you're so reliant on 
 these tools and just how do you keep the 
 quality of this stuff up and not just 
 like me it's just a bunch of AI 
 generated slop? 
 >> I have a a very strong disagree to to to 
 this and I've heard it a bunch. I 
 remember when I started using Talviv um 
 has like this whole course on on 
 building a PM co-pilot using projects uh 
 which is probably one of the best 
 courses uh that you can take and when I 
 started working with my own co-pilot I 
 remember people at work looking and 
 saying like oh so you're basically 
 outsourcing your thinking and to me 
 that's just the worst way to look at it 
 and I think for some reason these people 
 usually 
 have a highore relation with the kind of 
 person who doesn't like to show their 
 presentation when it's only 10% done or 
 doesn't want to ask for help a lot. I 
 think that there's a misconception with 
 a lot of PMs that the job is always 
 having the right answers and being the 
 smartest person in the room. And at 
 least how I was trained and how I 
 believe the the role of the PM is, it's 
 the exact opposite. It's basically 
 harnessing anything that can get us uh 
 as quick as possible to delivering the 
 the right solution to users. And I just 
 think this is like that really smart 
 person that has context or or your 
 mentor or whatever, but is just always 
 available and doesn't judge you and uh 
 can really help you. So, if you're using 
 it to just create your outputs and then 
 putting them out there, um I mean, yeah, 
 that's AI slot, but it's also human 
 error. I think it's really important 
 that you own your own outputs. If you 
 put anything out there or um show 
 something in a product review and you 
 say, "Oh, sorry, that was built by AI," 
 that's that's your mistake. I think if 
 you use these intentionally and and 
 really take the time to understand how 
 to use AI in the correct way, it's one 
 of the biggest game changers that will 
 make you much better as a PM. And 
 another thing here is that especially 
 for more junior PMs, it allows you to 
 play at such a higher level than you 
 would normally. Like I think that at 
 Wix, I wasn't thinking of what's the 
 marketing strategy uh of the company and 
 how will the onboarding be completely 
 revamped within the all of the whole 
 product. But I mean on my side product, 
 I can just do whatever decisions I want 
 and think of the strategy and marketing 
 and the messaging. And this is basically 
 just getting me uh reps uh which is one 
 of the most important things at the 
 beginning of your career. So I 
 understand the fear that you know how do 
 you you outsource certain stuff and 
 you're not owning 100% of everything but 
 I think the upside is so much more 
 valuable. And I think the only way that 
 AI makes you worse at your job is if 
 you're using it wrong. Is there anything 
 that you've learned about reducing the 
 the sloppiness, the slopiness of the 
 output? Just like a tip for keeping the 
 quality high of the stuff that it 
 produces. 
 >> Similar to people setting up AI for 
 success for the task at hand. So like if 
 I just brought in, you know, uh a junior 
 to to write a deck or something and I 
 didn't give it any guideline. I just 
 said give a strategy deck. he would 
 probably just go online and find, you 
 know, top strategy deck and and just 
 reproduce that, which is basically what 
 AI is doing. It's basically just fed all 
 of the internet. So, 
 instead of that guiding it and giving it 
 context on what your style of writing is 
 and what you're trying to solve, um, and 
 all these different things, I think 
 that's probably one of the biggest 
 unlocks. Um, so that's just a quick tip. 
 And also uh cursor has a slash command 
 called ds slop which is basically going 
 back over the code. Um I don't know if 
 this is integrated into the product yet 
 but it's uh on Twitter their founders 
 have been talking about this. So that's 
 definitely something I would run after 
 just to make sure that no no slop is is 
 left behind. 
 >> That is so funny. The slop. Okay. One 
 more question uh which may lead to 
 something else but um kind of going in a 
 whole different direction. you used AI 
 to help you actually interview for the 
 job that you got at Meta. Talk about how 
 you did that because a lot of people 
 right now are struggling to find a job. 
 Uh reading about all these people using 
 AI to help them interview. You actually 
 did it. Uh what did you use? What 
 worked? 
 >> I feel like the analogy here is I have 
 12 nieces and nephews and you can see 
 how people who have grown up in a 
 different world how their mind is is 
 formed differently. So, if you ask me, 
 "How do you answer a phone?" I'll do 
 this. But a uh a child now when you say, 
 "How do you answer the phone?" they'll 
 they'll do this. You know, they'll do 
 the the the iPhone answer. And I feel 
 like people who are um growing up now in 
 their professional lives, we're the same 
 just with AI. So, every time I'm faced 
 with a new challenge or problem, I think 
 AI first how to solve it. So, uh Meta 
 reached out and said they'd like me to 
 interview. Straight away, I opened up a 
 project um within Claude. I started 
 looking online for all the best 
 information out there, things that I 
 resonated with. I took a ton of 
 frameworks and and stuff from Ben Arez, 
 who's written a guest post uh for you, 
 who I think is one of the best minds out 
 there right now. And basically, I 
 created a project which was my coach uh 
 which I would come and consult what to 
 do at each phase. I would mock interview 
 with and this was amazing. Also I 
 created a game in base 44 which helped 
 me uh I was really struggling with 
 segmentation uh within the product 
 questions. So thinking of the correct 
 segments. So I basically just created a 
 quiz game which creates questions and 
 different segmentations and I have to 
 choose uh so this is like I spun this 
 up. It's a web app that I would play 
 sometimes when I was on the bus to work. 
 So basically, uh, I think Ben talks 
 about this a bunch, so I don't like just 
 go read Ben's stuff, but just creating a 
 project and feeding it with all the best 
 information on the internet and then 
 mocking a bunch. I will say that the 
 biggest game changer for me was doing uh 
 human mocks. So cold outreaching to 
 people uh on LinkedIn and having them uh 
 do actual mocks for me. I think that at 
 the end of the day, especially for the 
 the meta PM prep, which is super 
 competitive and difficult, uh I think 
 there's no there's no way to to get 
 around that. 
 >> That is so cool. They use that post. I 
 wasn't aware. We're going to link to it. 
 And in that post, Ben shares all these 
 prompts you can feed chatbt to help you 
 prepare for interviews, do uh mocks 
 online. Uh it's a really important point 
 to say that those are take you to a 
 point, but it's actually better to use 
 humans. I actually have a post coming 
 out soon uh in collaboration with Nome 
 Seagal about how everyone's using AI to 
 interview and one of the most 
 interesting ways I've heard people and 
 that we found in this research was that 
 people use it to get feedback. They 
 record the interview and then it gives 
 them feedback. Here's where you could 
 have done better. Here's what you here's 
 what you missed because the feedback 
 loop is so missing. No one ever tells 
 you here's what you did badly in this 
 interview. No one tells you that 
 >> and AI can do that. 
 >> So I'll add two things to that. one 
 which is uh exactly this. So I'll mock 
 with um AI. Also I did something really 
 cool where there's a question bank 
 online uh free uh by Lewis Lynn which 
 basically is an always updating uh bank 
 of questions that people are asked in 
 real interviews and I basically uh used 
 uh comet which is the perplexities 
 browser and I had the agent run all 
 kinds of analyses on like what the most 
 asked questions are and that's how I 
 knew how to prioritize what questions I 
 would mock. Um, and then at the end of 
 these mocks, I would, um, tell Claude 
 within the project, um, you're my coach, 
 and I don't want you to make me feel 
 good. I want you to make me, um, as 
 ready as possible for these interviews, 
 so give me feedback, like you said. Um, 
 and the other thing that I did was 
 really cool was some questions where I 
 didn't have time to mock, I would ask 
 Claude to play the candidate, and then 
 it would just give me a really good 
 answer, and I could also learn from 
 that. Like learning from someone who 
 does a perfect answer. Oh man, I I 
 really love the way you phrased it that 
 people kind of in your generation, the 
 default is I have something I need to 
 do. What? Let's go to AI immediately and 
 and help me prepare for this thing. Help 
 me figure it out. 
 >> Yeah. And this comes back to this quote 
 that I always think about which I think 
 everyone's always hearing, but I just 
 it's such an important quote that it's 
 not that you will be replaced by AI for 
 a long time. It's you'll be replaced by 
 someone who's better at using AI than 
 you. 
 >> I agree. And that's what these 
 conversations are for, to help people 
 keep up with all that and to and to 
 learn some of these skills and again see 
 where the future's going and and start 
 to learn how to get there yourself. 
 Okay, Zevy. Uh before we get to a very 
 exciting lightning round, I'm going to 
 take us to a recurring segment on this 
 podcast I call failure corner. And why I 
 love this segment is people come on 
 this, you know, just even this 
 conversation, it's like all these 
 amazing things you figured out, 
 everything's going so well. People 
 rarely hear the things that don't go 
 well and those are often the most 
 interesting and impactful stories. So 
 the question is just what's a what's a 
 story of a time you failed in your 
 career and what did you learn from that 
 experience? 
 >> Yeah, I love this. I love this uh I love 
 failure corner. Big big fan. Um so I'll 
 tell a story about uh when I started at 
 Wix. So basically I started within Wix's 
 student program and straight out of the 
 student program you get um put into a 
 certain team. So, I was in the editor, 
 which is uh the core product of Wix. And 
 the other PMs were just the best PMs 
 almost at Wix. Like these four other 
 people uh had much more experience than 
 me and they were ridiculously good. And 
 I remember coming in and thinking like 
 my first product review, I'm going to 
 blow these people's socks off. They're 
 not going to believe how good of a PM I 
 am. And I basically didn't really share 
 what I was thinking. Uh, I would work 
 tons of hours alone and I was like, I'm 
 going to kill this product review. 
 They're going to be so impressed. Uh, 
 and I ended up failing miserably. Uh, my 
 product review was not good. Uh, it 
 wasn't the format they expected. They 
 had a ton of questions that I missed. 
 Um, and I felt awful when it was when it 
 was over. I was like, "Ah, you're such 
 an idiot." And I saw that everyone was 
 like, "All right, cool. Yeah, just come 
 back in two weeks and and we'll keep 
 we'll keep getting at this." And I I 
 understood in that moment that they had 
 zero expectation of me being a 10x PM, 
 but the expectation of me was being a 
 10x learner. And the second I understood 
 that, my whole mindset sw uh shifted. 
 And I think this is probably the best 
 tip that I give now uh to junior PMs is 
 basically 
 be the best learner you can be at the 
 beginning. No one expects you to know 
 all the answers and no one expects you 
 to be good. So basically what I did was 
 I took each person on the PM team, there 
 was four other PMs and I assessed what 
 their strength is and use them as a 
 mentor for that. So Ner who's still my 
 uh mentor till today, he has the best 
 product sense of anyone I've met. Oya is 
 super uh she's like a methodology expo 
 expert. She just thinks in frameworks. 
 Um Yara who was the head of product 
 basically can look at a product and then 
 instantly understand like the third and 
 fourth order effects of them system 
 thinking. So every time I had an issue 
 with one of these areas, I would come to 
 one of them um and consult them. And 
 this does two things. First of all, I 
 learned a ton. And the second thing is 
 that when the next time the next product 
 review, my success felt to them like 
 their success cuz it wasn't this kid 
 who's trying to show us up how cool he 
 is. It was um like our mentee kind of 
 making us all proud. Um and it was such 
 a great shift for me and basically at 
 the end of the day I I really excelled 
 through this. 
 >> That is an awesome story and this 
 connect this idea of learning is such a 
 good thread throughout this whole 
 conversation that uh AI is is good at 
 getting stuff done but it's also really 
 good at helping you learn how to do the 
 thing and to be this partner this 
 thought partner. the way he talked about 
 the interview process you went through 
 and this learning learning opportunity 
 command. Um so awesome great story uh 
 Zevy. Okay, before we get to a very 
 exciting lighting round, is there 
 anything else that you wanted to share? 
 Anything you want to leave listeners 
 with? 
 >> Yeah, so kind of to tie back into the uh 
 first thing I said where if people walk 
 away thinking um Zevy's so cool then 
 then I've failed here. I think that it's 
 just the best time to be alive. I think 
 it's the best time to be a junior. Uh 
 contra contrary to what a lot of people 
 are saying how, you know, there's no 
 more junior roles out there and people 
 get out of school and you you can't find 
 a role. Yeah, that's true. But also, 
 when else in history could you get out 
 of school and just build a startup, you 
 know, on your own with a couple of 
 friends uh completely bootstrapped? And 
 I see more and more people uh towards my 
 end of towards the end of the time at my 
 time at Wix, I was interviewing and I 
 saw more and more people building their 
 own stuff with AI. And I think uh 
 contrary to what a lot of people think, 
 it's the best time to be a junior. It's 
 the best time to be a learner. And I 
 think if any listener is listening to 
 this and you're a curious person, you're 
 a hardworking person, I I want to say 
 kind, I'm not sure, but if you're a kind 
 person and a good communicator, you have 
 such an unfair advantage and you can 
 give more value to companies than most 
 people who have 20 years of experience. 
 So, uh I really hope people get inspired 
 by this and uh start killing it with 
 their projects. 
 >> Amazing. So many ways to be inspired 
 from this conversation. See, with that, 
 we've reached our very exciting 
 lightning round. I've got five questions 
 for you. Are you ready? 
 >> Yep. Let's do it. 
 >> What are two or three books that you 
 find yourself recommending most to other 
 people? 
 >> So, I'll I'll take one from each kind of 
 genre. Um, so in like fiction, I love 
 The Fountain Head uh by A Rand. One of 
 my favorite books. Uh, really makes you 
 think, really makes you feel. Um, 
 business books, I'm a big fan of Shoe 
 Dog, uh, the Nike story. One of my 
 favorite 
 >> just finished reading that. So funny. 
 >> Amazing. 
 >> It was great. It was great. 
 >> Yeah. I love Shoe Dog. Um and then more 
 on like the psychology side uh mindset 
 by Carol Dick, who uh coined the term 
 growth mindset. It's just such an 
 amazing book. It kind of sounds like a 
 self-help book, but then you you 
 understand that it's completely 
 psychological and and is based on 
 research. Um and that book completely 
 changed my life. uh really I was always 
 with a fixed mindset and then after 
 reading that I kind of understood uh 
 that it was something holding me back 
 and since then I've been really really 
 trying to cultivate a growth mindset. So 
 I really recommend everyone reading that 
 >> again connects to that thread of uh the 
 way you described it being a 10x learner 
 versus a 10x uh doer. Okay, next 
 question. Favorite recent movie or TV 
 show you have really enjoyed. 
 >> Yeah, actually my my wife is really into 
 film so we watch a lot of TV. Uh it's 
 probably our our favorite uh together 
 time. Uh I just finished watching The 
 Pit, which was amazing. Uh it was really 
 good. And the my first recommendation to 
 everyone is if you haven't seen 
 Severance, run to see Severance, one of 
 my favorite shows. 
 >> Is there a favorite product that you 
 have recently discovered that you really 
 love? 
 >> This is a good question. I'm always 
 trying new products. Like I'll always 
 have uh three or four browsers on 
 installed on my computer and all this 
 different kind of stuff. Um, and I 
 recently discovered a Loom alternative. 
 Um, I was kind of disappointed with 
 Loom. They were taking so much money and 
 the product, uh, I don't know, I just 
 didn't love it. And there's an open 
 source alternative called CAP, which is 
 just really wellcrafted. Um, you can see 
 that the person was like really sweating 
 the details and, uh, it's just a really, 
 really great alternative. So, I've been 
 using that recently. 
 >> There's also a product called Supercut 
 that I love that's also a Luma 
 alternative. a shout out. Okay, two more 
 questions. Do you have a favorite life 
 motto that you find yourself uh coming 
 back to in work or in life? 
 >> Yeah, I'm kind of between two right now. 
 One which is like become a Twitter meme 
 basically, which is you can just do 
 things. I feel like that is basically 
 going in my head every time I do 
 something that I'm just shocked at the 
 speed and and ability to do things now. 
 Uh so you can just do things. And the 
 second one I stole from my brother. His 
 motto is nobody knows what the 
 they're doing. And I just love that and 
 I think it kind of makes you take life 
 more lightly. Uh so yeah, nobody knows 
 what the they're doing. 
 >> I think people see these companies on 
 the outside and it feels like everything 
 they've got all figured out and if 
 you're ever on the inside of a company 
 that's doing really well, you're like, 
 how is this staying on the rails? How is 
 this still a thing that is working? 
 Doesn't make any sense. It's all about 
 to fall apart. 
 >> Yeah. 
 >> Okay, last question. uh you've been 
 you've had a long entrepreneurial 
 uh thread throughout your career. 
 There's a couple other uh real world 
 businesses you've started in the past. 
 You did a thermal clothing business and 
 then like a hummus delivery thing. So 
 maybe pick one of those and just tell 
 the story of what that's about. 
 >> Yeah, I'd love to. Uh really fun that 
 you asked about this. Um so 
 I'll tell the thermal clothing because I 
 think it's really cool. So, in high 
 school, I was selling thermal clothes in 
 10th grade uh for for one of my sister's 
 friends or something. And basically, it 
 was just uh packs of thermal clothing, 
 uh shirt and pants. Uh I grew up in 
 Jerusalem, so it's a bit chillier there, 
 so it was perfect for for the weather. 
 And in 10th grade when I was selling 
 them, they were like 20 $25 a piece and 
 I was making like $4 a sale. And if you 
 look in the food chain, I was like sixth 
 or seventh down the line. So this was 
 like crazy margins. So during the summer 
 I thought about it like I should just go 
 straight to the importer. So throughout 
 the summer I called the importer and at 
 first he was really really mad. He was 
 like no you have to work for me for 
 years to get to this state. And I said 
 listen man I'm finishing school soon. 
 This is not going to be my career. 
 Either do it or not. And we basically 
 negotiated uh throughout the whole 
 summer. And this was also like how I did 
 things before Chachi PT. So he would 
 like throw out something. He'd say, "Oh, 
 the import tax has gone up." And I'll 
 just search Google like import tax 
 Israel. And like start reading and I'll 
 be on the phone with him and I'll be 
 like, "Hey, uh I would just basically 
 stall." And then I'd somehow come back 
 with a uh with a challenge. Um and I 
 ended up uh getting a really great 
 price, like $125 a piece. So I was 
 making like 100% profit. And I spread 
 throughout a bunch of different schools. 
 each school I had the coolest people in 
 school uh selling for me. Um and then 
 the cool a really fun thing that I did 
 was we had a really awesome basketball 
 team and like our basketball team would 
 basically be 30 points up within the 
 first half. Um and it kind of got boring 
 for the crowd. So, I wrote a song like a 
 basketball chant about thermal clothes 
 that basically has my number within it 
 and like the end of it was um if you 
 join in now will give you a discount and 
 it like it was with drums and everything 
 and still when I go to Jerusalem I know 
 like some people who I don't even know 
 like know my number by heart because 
 they know it by the tune and sometimes 
 when I walk in Jerusalem people stop me 
 and say like hey it's thermals heavy so 
 that was just a really cool experience 
 um as a kid. This explains so much. Such 
 a just the marketing genius of that 
 move. Oh man. Okay, Zevy, this was 
 incredible. Two final questions. Where 
 can folks find you if they want to reach 
 out, maybe follow up on some of the 
 stuff? We'll link to the scripts and 
 prompts and all that in the show notes. 
 So, uh, so you don't have to read that. 
 And then, uh, how can listeners be 
 useful to you? 
 >> Awesome. Um, so I've been helped 
 throughout my whole career a ton. So, I 
 love helping any way I can. So reach out 
 on LinkedIn uh or on X. I' I'd really 
 love to help whoever I can. How can you 
 use uh listeners be useful to me? So if 
 you're a student, try Studymate. Tell me 
 what you think. Uh if you're in Israel 
 and you're not using dictation yet, try 
 the vortex. Tell me what you think. 
 >> Amazing. Uh I just love how much how 
 much you're giving away and how useful 
 this can be to so many people. So again, 
 we'll link to that in the show notes. Uh 
 Zebie, you're awesome. Thank you so much 
 for being here. Thank you so much for 
 sharing so much. that's going to help I 
 think a lot of people and I think it's 
 going to help people get over the hump 
 on okay I see all these people doing 
 cool stuff here's how I can actually do 
 this stuff so uh thank you so much for 
 being here and for sharing so much 
 >> thank you for having me and if you build 
 something cool with uh some stuff that I
