## Test Credentials for Funnel Analysis

When capturing funnels, filling forms, or testing user flows:

- **Email**: `test@testtest1.com` (increment number if already used: `test2@testtest1.com`, `test3@testtest1.com`, etc.)
- **Name**: `Test User`
- **Phone**: `+1234567890` (if needed)

## Funnel Analysis Guidelines

When analyzing quiz funnels or onboarding flows:

1. Always use the test credentials above for form fields
2. If an email is rejected (already registered), increment the number and retry
3. Capture screenshots at each step with `encoded: true` for file saving
4. Document all screen types, question formats, and conversion tactics
5. Pay attention to:
   - Progress indicators
   - CTA button text
   - Trust signals and social proof
   - Urgency/scarcity elements
   - Pricing structures on paywalls
